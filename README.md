Scouting neuroimaging methods
===============================================

I respond to investigator questions about whether specific neuroimaging techniques might be added to our core services. My responses include an assessment of the time, personnel, and computing resources that would be required to import a new technique.

This repository only exists to support my speedy response to those investigator querries. I manage methodological trials of new techniques elsewhere, generally in individual repos.
